# Kaggle Competition - Distracted Drivers 

As a final project for the course <a href="https://www.kth.se/social/course/DD2427/">Image Based Recognition and Classification</a> we tried to solve the <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/c/state-farm-distracted-driver-detection"> 
Distracted Drivers competition</a> on Kaggle. The aim of this competition was to build a program that can detect distracted drivers and classify the source of 
distraction based on given image data. In order to do so we use Googleâ€™s TensorFlow to build a convolutional network that 
can classify the image data of drivers. An analysis of different approaches, network architectures, parameter settings and image distortions and 
their effect on the classification accuracy is provided.
